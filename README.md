ObjectMapper
============

A java library for the automatic mapping of custom classes to and from XML/SOAP. With ObjectMapper, you can build XML and SOAP packets automatically based on your complex objects, potentially saving hundreds of lines of serialization code.

##Download
Here you can Download the latest jar. to add into your project.
[ObjectMapper 1.0.1](https://github.com/uacaps/ObjectMapper/raw/master/ObjectMapper.jar)

##OMSerializer##

The OMSerializer is an annotation interface that allows you to map the correct variable name to serialize to for soap and xml.

Ex. 

```java
@OMSerializer("name")
private String _name;
```
Now instead of the ObjectMapper mapping "_name" to the variable name it will map it to "name" and visa versa on the way back to being an object.

##Object Setup##

* This is a simple custom object.
* To name variables you may name them exactly how you want them to be mapped in the xml\soap or you may use the @OMSerializer to override the name as shown above.
* Each object must have a blank constructor so that me the ObjectMapper is able to map to it and do its magic.
* Otherwise you may set the variable how you like public, protected, private or default it works no matter how those are set. 


Ex.
```java
public SomeObject{

	private String String1;
	@OMSerializer("String2")
	private String _str2;

	public SomeObject(){
		//NOTE: You must have a blank contructor. For ObjectMapper to work correctly.
	}
		 
	public SomeObject(String str1,String str2){
		this.String1 = str1;
		this._str2 = str2;
	}
		
		
	public String getString1(){
		return this.String1;
	}
	public String get_str2(){
		return this._str2;
	}
	public void set_str1(String string){
		this.String1 = string;
	}
	public void set_str2(String string){
		this._str2 = string;
	}

}
```

##Serializing##

**Object to Xml**

To serialize an object to xml

1. Make the object and set variables.

2. Call ObjectMapper.toXML(YOUROBJECT);

Ex.

```java
SomeObject so = new SomeObject("Freaking", "Magic");
String Text = ObjectMapper.toXml(so);
System.out.println(text);
```
Output :
```
<SomeObject>
	<String1>Freaking</String1>
	<String2>Magic</String2>
</SomeObject>
```
##Deserializing##

**Xml to Object**

To deserialize back to object.

1. Valid XML

2. Object to map back to.

3. Call ObjectMapper.fromXml(YOURXML, YOUROBJECT.class);

```java
SomeObject so = new SomeObject("Freaking", "Magic");
String Text = ObjectMapper.toXml(so);
SomeObject so2 = ObjectMapper.fromXml(text,SomeObject.class);

System.out.println(so2.String1);

```

Output: Freaking

**Object to soap**
